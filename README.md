# Credit EDA Case Study ðŸ’³ðŸ“Š

## Overview
This project performs an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a credit dataset to uncover key insights related to customer behavior and creditworthiness. Using various data analysis techniques, this project aims to help financial institutions assess credit risk and make informed lending decisions.

## Key Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Removed missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies to prepare the data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Utilized descriptive statistics and visualizations to explore the relationships between various features.
- **Feature Engineering**: Created new features that provide deeper insights into customer behavior and lending risks.
- **Business Insights**: Derived actionable insights to assist financial institutions in better assessing credit risk.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For data analysis and manipulation.
- **Pandas**: Data handling and manipulation.
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization libraries for generating insights.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive exploration and documentation.

## File Structure
The repository consists of the following files:
- `Credit_EDA_Case_Study.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the full exploratory data analysis.
- `Credit_EDA_Case_Study.html`: HTML version of the notebook for easy viewing.
- `Credit EDA Case Study.pptx`: PowerPoint presentation summarizing the findings of the analysis.
- `Credit EDA Case Study.pdf`: PDF version of the analysis report.
- `README.md`: The current file, describing the project details and instructions.

## Business Questions Explored
1. **Credit Score Distribution**: What does the distribution of credit scores look like across customers?
2. **Loan Amount vs. Credit Score**: Is there a relationship between loan amount and credit score?
3. **Income and Loan Default**: Does income level impact the likelihood of default?
4. **Payment History Trends**: How does payment history affect credit score and default risk?
5. **Predictors of Default**: Which features are most predictive of customer default?

## Insights Delivered
1. **Credit Score Distribution**: Most customers have mid-range credit scores, with fewer at the extremes.
   - **Insight**: Institutions should focus on mid-range score customers for potential lending opportunities.
   
2. **Loan Amount vs. Credit Score**: Lower credit scores are correlated with smaller loan amounts.
   - **Insight**: Individuals with lower credit scores may apply for smaller loans but pose a higher risk of default.

3. **Income vs. Loan Default**: Higher-income customers generally have a lower default rate.
   - **Insight**: Income is a significant factor in assessing loan repayment potential.

4. **Payment History Trends**: Delayed payments are associated with lower credit scores and a higher likelihood of default.
   - **Insight**: Payment history is a crucial factor for assessing customer risk.

5. **Correlation Analysis**: Features like credit score, loan amount, and income show strong correlations with default risk.
   - **Insight**: Credit scores and income are key indicators for predicting customer behavior.

## Visualizations
Several visualizations were created to support the analysis, including:
- **Credit Score Distribution**: Histogram representing customer credit scores.
- **Loan Amount vs. Credit Score**: Scatter plot showing the relationship between loan amounts and credit scores.
- **Income vs. Default**: Bar plot comparing income levels and default rates.
- **Payment History vs. Credit Score**: Line chart illustrating the impact of payment history on credit scores.
